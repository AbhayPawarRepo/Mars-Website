<title>Mars & Beyond</title>
<p>"You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great -and thats what 
    being a spacefaring civilization is all about.It's about believing in the future and thinking that the 
    future will be better than the past. And I can't think of anything more exciting than going out
    there and being among the starts.""

<h2>Why Mars?</h2>
<p>At an average distance of 140 million miles, Mars is one of 
    Earth's closest habitable neighbors. Mars is about half again as 
    far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight. It is 
    a little cold, but we can warm it up. Its atmosphere is primarily 
    CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace 
    elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just 
    by compressing the atmosphere. Gravity on Mars is about 38% 
    of that of Earth, so you would be able to lift heavy things and 
    bound around. Furthermore, the day is remarkably close to that of Earth.
